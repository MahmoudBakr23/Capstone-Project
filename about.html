            <p class="bordered-p">A very excited journey with a lot to learn and a lot to explore in the game industry.<br>I've started this journey on sep, 2019 with the Game Design and Development Specialization from Michigan State University,<br>which I've finished it in 4 months.<br>The specialization contained 5 courses I'm going to discuss in a while.<br>While was making progress in the track, I also was trying to learn some new techniques that improved my skills as a game developer and provided me a deeper understanding in the game industry.</p>
            <p class="contact">Notice: You can enroll for just 1 course and you don't have to take the whole track, but it's strongly recommended!</p>
